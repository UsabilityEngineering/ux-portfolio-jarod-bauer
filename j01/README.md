# Where's the power button?
### Jarod Bauer - 10 March 2023

### It was back in 2014 when I was given the playstation 4 to me for my birthday. As I began setting it up for the first time, my happiness quickly turned to confusion. Something as simple as the power button was able to hinder my ability to use the console. If you havent used a playstation 4 before, have a look at this photo and see if you can find all of the necessary buttons.
