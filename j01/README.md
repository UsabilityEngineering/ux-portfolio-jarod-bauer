# Where's the power button?
### Jarod Bauer - 10 March 2023

#### It was back in 2014 when I was given the playstation 4 to me for my birthday. As I began setting it up for the first time, my happiness quickly turned to confusion. Something as simple as the power button was able to hinder my ability to use the console. If you havent used a playstation 4 before, have a look at this photo and see if you can find all of the necessary buttons.

#### I used a stock photo, because my personal/original PS4 is completely sticker bombed and would be quite hard to use as an example. But, as you can probably tell, there isn't exactly a lot of buttons or ports noticeable at first glance of this console. If you take another look here, I circled where two of the buttons are, the power button, and the disk-eject button.

#### Now after knowing where these buttons are, you would think the process should be just about done. However, mine and many others first time using these PS4 buttons caused even more confusion. Pressing this button, and using any pressure in general actually does nothing. This is because the button is actually a sensor, which is actually **satisfying** once you understand how to use it. But, this sensor for some reason won't register a press if you use too much pressure, requiring the user to already know how it works and to just lightly hover their finger over it. 

#### These sensor's were definitely **memorable** after a few uses of remembering to lightly tap it. In fact, the sensor was a bit of a blessing and a curse. For example, my father would always come storming into my room for me being too loud or maybe because I was on the game too late. He would always rush to push the power button and turn off my console, which would leave 14-15 year old me laughing up a storm as he rushed in angry and struggled to turn it off since the sensor would never read his attempts at a button press.

#### While this design is certainly not user-friendly at first, it became incredibly**efficient**after mastering it's use.

#### Along with the sensor being a bit confusing to new users. For some reason, Playstation decided to give the original PS4 only 2 USB slots which was quite a nuissance for many players as this was enough for potentially a headset and controller charger, but nothing else. To combat all of these issues and complaints, Playstation released the PS4 slim, and eventually the pro. Both of these new consoles had a real pushable button for the power, removing the sensor system. They also only came with 2 USB ports but Playstation began selling an accessory for the console that would add a couple more USB ports.

#### Throughout it's lifespan, the PS4 came a long way in terms of user experience, and these changes and thoughts were eventually utilized in the creation of the PS5.
